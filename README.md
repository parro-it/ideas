# ideas
This repo contains ideas for future modules

If you come here, feel free to open an issue to point me to an existing one that already exists or to purpose a collaboration to actually get it done.

* A module to open issue on GH or Bitbucket via command line
* A module to create a GH or Bitbucket repo via command line
* A module to create a gist via command line (I think it already exists, I'll investigate)
