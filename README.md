# ideas
This repo contains ideas for future node modules I want to build

If you come here, feel free to open an issue to point me to an existing one that already exists or to purpose a collaboration to actually get it done.

* A module to open issue on GH or Bitbucket via command line
* A module to create a GH or Bitbucket repo via command line
* A module to create a gist via command line (I think it already exists, I'll investigate)
