# ideas
This repo contains ideas for future node modules I want to build

If you come here, feel free to open an issue to point me to an existing one that already exists or to purpose a collaboration to actually get it done.

<s>* A module to open issue on GH or Bitbucket via command line
* A module to create a GH or Bitbucket repo via command line
  (for github, use http://mikedeboer.github.io/node-github)</s>

For this two, i'll use https://github.com/node-gh/gh

* A module to import issues on GH or Bitbucket from md file containing list of issues 
* A module to create a gist via command line (I think it already exists, I'll investigate)
* A module to simulate node Response and request object using fetch interfaces, to allow implementation of a node server in browser serviceworker
